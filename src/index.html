        <p>
          I am foremost a Software Developer. However, I have lead integration,
          performed DevOps tasks and even spent enough time on test teams to 
          truly understand and value what they bring to the table. If I had 
          my way, I would always be doing full stack development work, starting
          at the data source through the enterprise layer and all the way to 
          the user interface. I am currently acting as the subject matter 
          expert for our overall UI strategy for my section of the enterprise 
          at Ft. Meade. This involves developing a system that will allow 
          several teams working on dozens of web applications to componentize
          and share web components and libraries to ultimately standardize and 
          unify our user interfaces to simplify maintenance and provide 
          continuity for our customer's user experience.

        <p class="dates-worked">March 2014 - Present</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Beginning in early 2014, Mr. Peters started working with REDBUS to implement 
            operator access to SIGINT capabilities developed in the REDHAWK SDR.  
            Using AngularJS, HTML5 and BootstrapJS, he developed user interfaces for 
            system metrics that allowed a user to monitor resources on the sensor and the 
            machine where REDBUS was installed.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2015, Mr. Peters became the sole enterprise/UI developer for a team of 
            Electrical Engineers developing SIGINT capabilities.  During this time, Mr. Peters 
            developed user interfaces and engineered back end solutions with REDBUS that 
            heavily involved the Redbus Driver - an OSGi component built to communicate 
            and simplify interaction with the REDHAWK SDR.  While working with the 
            Redhawk Driver, Mr. Peters found it necessary to refactor the component 
            to introduce buffering for streaming data, change the implementation of CORBA 
            and patch the software for bugs. This experience makes him the most knowledgeable 
            engineer besides the original developers with regard to the driver and its 
            interaction with REDHAWK.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2016, Mr. Peters pivoted to Lead Developer on another project, BLUECONDOR. 
            BLUECONDOR centered around improving development and deployment for capabilities 
            using the REDHAWK SDR.  His duties included: Software development for the Raptor X 
            UI framework, requirements evolution, development of user stories and feature 
            planning. The main frameworks in use on BLUECONDOR are: Java Swing for thick 
            client support, Node.js, AngularJS and BootstrapJS for thin client development. 
            One major success Mr. Peters had while developing on BLUECONDOR was the single 
            handed design and implementation of the Graceland dependency injection framework 
            which is currently in use for testing and componentization of the server side 
            portion of the thin client application.
          <li>
            August 2017, Mr. Peters began work on EXTRAINNINGS. His full stack skills have 
            been an asset to this project. While on EXTRAINNINGS, Mr. Peters moved back into 
            his primary skillset of Enterprise Java Developer.  He developed enterprise services 
            and led integration with external systems and CORBA enabled services developed 
            in the REDHAWK SDR.  Also, while at EXTRAINNINGS, Mr. Peters has contributed 
            significantly to the STRETCHRUN user interface by developing UI services in 
            AngularJS while designing a strategy to modernize the interface by incrementally 
            moving to the modern Web Component framework Vue.js and Spring MVC/Boot.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="first-element">Collabraspace</h5>
        <p class="dates-worked">February 2011 - March 2014</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Mr. Peters worked on four projects while working at Collabraspace: 
            ESEA an NSA Project, DCGS-IC a ground station for the intelligence community, 
            GISA and CAGE3A which are Australian knowledge management projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            On ESEA, he performed duties as software developer.  This involved code management 
            using subversion and J2EE software development specifically using EJB3 with Oracle 
            and EXT/JS.  Some very complex challenges included creating an Excel Spreadsheet 
            that could be dynamically updated using an Oracle database as a data source.  
            The solution demanded that Mr. Peters learn the programming language VBS 
            sufficiently and implement his solution in about two weeks.  Mr. Peters was also 
            responsible for developing Oracle SQL scripts that were used to carefully migrate 
            existing production data every time the database schema changed. This task helped 
            Mr. Peters become very familiar with SQL syntax.
          </li>
          <li>
            On DCGS-IC, his role changed to automation developer which involved automating 
            installation tasks of a very large scale software system using PowerShell and 
            Power-CLI for controlling virtual machines and deploying software packages.  
            This role also involved taking over duties of CM by writing subversion triggers 
            using Python and developing software to automate unit testing of JavaScript 
            client side code.  This experience was further augmented when Mr. Peters became 
            responsible for implementing Continuous Integration for his team’s OWF widgets.  Thus, he became the end-to-end subject matter expert for test and integration on the DCGS-IC modular code base.  Also on DCGS-IC, Mr. Peters used his previous experience with Java and EXT/JS to develop the widgets that made up the modular code base. 
          </li>
          <li> 
While on GISA, due to being proficient on Linux and Windows XP and all software packages necessary, Mr. Peters was immediately tasked with setting up the development environment before the project began.  This task included standing up servers to support Archive management with Archiva, Continuous Integration using Jenkins and Subversion.  He was responsible for importing select portions of the existing code base from DCGS-IC and preparing the environment for other developers to work on the project. After the environment was in place, Mr. Peters became the lead developer and managed up to three other developers.  During this time, Mr. Peters worked with customers to create, analyze, prioritize, and schedule team requirements as well as design and implement new modular software components using Tomcat, Weblogic 10, Java and EXT/JS.
          </li>
          <li>
CAGE3A was an extension of GISA, so many of Mr. Peters’s responsibilities remained the same. New tasks included learning workflow software (e.POWER), creating custom workflows for Australian Army artillery target packs with e.POWER and researching integration strategies for the target pack software with already existing systems in country and automating the installation of open source WMS server GeoServer with PostGIS. All scripting tasks were written in Perl.
